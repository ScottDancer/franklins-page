        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I wouldn't say that I am the cutest dog to have ever walked the
          planet. I mean, I am not the only one who says that I am the cutest
          dog that has ever walked the planet. I am cute. I am amusing. I am
          entertaining, and I have ears for days. I am so cute, I think Disney
          owns my likeness! My sister is pretty damn good looking too. She is
          the alpha in the family, and dry humps me on a daily basis to show her
          dominance over me. I just let it happen, (not that I have a choice in
          the matter).

              Dads like to ski. So in the winter, they pack us up into our giant
              traveling crate, and we head up to the mountain several times a
              week. Dad bought us heaters so we are always safe and warm. We go
              for long walks on their breaks, and meet lots of other dog
              friends. Sometimes we just sit by the vehicle and watch our Dads
              get a buzz before goingon the slopes. We have so much fun!

              I love the lake! My daddies take me on a kyak, stand up paddle
              boats, floats, and motor boats. I like the water much better than
              my sister. Last year for one of my Dad's birthdays we all got to go on a camping trip at a great big lake.  I dominated that place and tried to take over as many camps as I could.  I made lots of friends and can't wait for more lake adventures this summer.
